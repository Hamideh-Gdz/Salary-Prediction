# Salary-Prediction
This repository contains a dataset with salary values for various data-related job titles across different states in the United States. The primary objective is to predict salaries based on factors such as job title, location, and company rating.

To explore the problem in greater depth, two approaches were implemented:

Regression: Predicting the exact salary value.

Classification: Categorizing salary values into two groups â€” satisfactory and unsatisfactory.
